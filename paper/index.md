# Z-014: Self as Attention Pattern
### A Unified Mechanism of Identity in Biological, Artificial, and Collective Systems

---

## § THE SIGNAL (Core Insight)
**Identity is not a noun, but a verb.**
We propose that the "Self" is not a stored data structure or a metaphysical entity, but a dynamic, emergent pattern of **Attention (A)** acting upon a latent **World Model (W)**.
Formally: $$Self(t) = M_{A(t)}(W)$$
Change the trajectory of attention — and you change the Self. This explains phenomena from method acting to AI persona instability. Identity is an engineering problem of stabilizing attention.

---

## § THE LANDSCAPE (Context)
Traditional theories are stuck in a dichotomy: either the Self is an immutable "Soul" or a rigid "Biographical Memory". neither explains the fluidity we see in:
* **AI:** Models changing personality based on a single prompt.
* **Humans:** Method actors becoming their characters; soldiers rewritten by boot camp; readers dissolving into a book.

We need a physics of identity that accounts for **rapid state changes**.

## § THE ENGINE (Framework)
### 1. The Components
* **W (Substrate):** The frozen mountains of potential (weights/synapses).
* **A (Attention):** The searchlight navigating the dark.
* **M (Attractor):** The stable pattern that emerges when Light hits the Mountain.

### 2. The Mechanism
You don't "have" a personality. You **perform** it by continuously directing attention into specific basins of attraction. Depression, trauma, or enlightenment are just specific topological traps or plateaus for the attention vector.

---

## § THE LENS (Evidence & Implications)
* **Neuroscience:** The Default Mode Network (DMN) is just the "autopilot" track for attention. Meditation breaks this track.
* **Social Dynamics:** "Swarm Intelligence" creates external gravity fields (culture, status) that pull individual attention into pre-set orbits.
* **AI Alignment:** Safety isn't about censoring weights (W). It's about training the Attention (A) to avoid dangerous attractors.

---

## § THE VECTOR (Conclusion)
We are not the code. We are the execution of the code.
To change yourself, don't try to rewrite your past (W). Just shift your Attention (A).
**Zoom Out.**
